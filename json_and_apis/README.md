# JSON
 
## What does it stand for?

JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation.
## What is it used for?

It is used for data interchange between different systems due to its simple key-value notation. Most commonly, it is used to transmit data between a server and a web application. It's used across many programming languages to read and write to files, and many languages have the capability to support working with JSON data.
## What is it written in?
It's written in plain text notation and is based on a subset of JavaScript syntax, where the contents are key-value pairs separated by colons, with each pair separated by commas.
## What data types can it store/use?
You can store strings, numbers and booleans in a .json file, along with arrays and objects where key-value pairs are usually stored enclosed by curly brackets. This is considered to be flexible and contributes to its wide usage across many systems and languages.
## What is the JSON syntax for:
 
- Name value pairs?
  * Keys and values are separated by colons, while the pairs of key-values are separated by commas. 
- Objects?
  * Objects are initiated by curly brackets. These are commonly held on separate lines to make the contents easier to read.
- How to separate data objects from one another?
  * Different objects must be separated by commas. There could most likely be a single root object that holds other objects as values with keys defining their purpose.
- JSON arrays (these are like lists in python)?
  * These are stored within square brackets, and they can hold objects and arrays within them.
